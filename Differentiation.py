#Exercise 5.21
#DIFFERENTIATION
'''
You have two charges, of Â±1 C, 10 cm apart. 
Calculate the resulting electric potential on a 1 m by 1 m square plane 
surrounding the charges and passing through them. Calculate the potential 
at 1 cm spaced points in a grid and make a visualization on the screen of 
the potential using a density plot.

Now calculate the partial derivatives of the potential with respect to 
x and y and hence find the electric field in the xy plane. Make a 
visualization of the field also. This is a little trickier than visualizing
the potential, because the electric field has both magnitude and direction. 
A visualization might use the arrow object from the visual package, drawing 
a grid of arrows with direction and length chosen to represent the field.

--> USE VECTOR PLOT
use contour plot and imshow

#To stay consistent we will do everything in meters
#10 cm is equivalent to 0.1 meters
#Our center point will be 0.5,0.5

#Therefore charge 2 will be at 0.55, 0.5, this will be -1
